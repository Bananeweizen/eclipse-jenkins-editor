## In a nutshell
Jenkins Editor is a plugin for eclipse to edit jenkins build files (JenkinsFile).

It supports
- Syntax coloring, customizeable, additional defaults for dark theme


## Dependencies
It is based on EGradle parts and needs at least the egradle-main plugin at runtime.
If you want to build it yourself you should checkout egradle and this repository inside ONE workspace.

Currently you must use the https://github.com/de-jcup/egradle/tree/feature/291-egradle-parts-for-jenkins-editor branch and NOT the master
